# Mindmup

## Local Method.
##### This method allows you to see what has been done by me. Its quick its easy but it does not really allow collaboration.

1. Save this github repository to your local drive.
2. Goto https://www.mindmup.com/
3. Open a map
4. Import a Freemind or Mindmup file

## Github method.
##### This method is longer but links mindmup into your github account. 
##### It is easy but you may need to make some changes to any and all organizations you own if you do not want those to be linked as well.
##### This method allows collaboration how is normally done on github. Cultivate an idea and push request when you feel the time is right.

1. Fork the repository on github.
2. Goto https://www.mindmup.com/
3. The next two steps temporary steps to get you where you need to go.
4. Create a new map
5. Public online map to share with the world
6. Click extensions and check the github extension.
7. Put a title in your new map and save it to github. This will initiate an authentication protocol that you must accept to be able to save/load your mindmup files stored on github.
